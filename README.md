# Drum-Kit-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-
A simple Drum Kit Simulator web application built using JavaScript. This project allows users to play various drum sounds either by clicking on the buttons or using their keyboard. Each button on the webpage corresponds to a different drum sound (e.g., tom, crash, snare, kick). The app also includes a visual animation effect when a drum is played.
